# simon-game

This project is a simple memorization game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core of the game revolves around sound cues and color recognition, challenging players to recall and repeat sequences of colored squares.

# Gameplay

Start the Game: The game begins by the player pressing any key.
Sequence Generation: In each round, one of the four different colored squares will produce a sound.
Player's Task: The player needs to press the squares in the same sequence as they made sounds.
Progression: With each round, the sequence gets longer, adding one more square to the existing sequence.
End Game: The game continues until the player makes a mistake, after which a 'You Lose' animation is displayed.

Successful Completion: The project was successfully completed, achieving the set goals.
Learning Curve: Through this project, I gained a solid understanding and practical experience in key HTML and CSS basics.
